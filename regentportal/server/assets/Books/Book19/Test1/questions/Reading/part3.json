The philosophers Descartes and Spinoza had **32** ________ about how people engage with information. While Descartes believed that people accept or reject information after considering whether it is true or not, Spinoza argued that people accepted all information they encountered (and by default misinformation) and did not verify or reject it until afterwards. Moreover, Spinoza believed that a distinct **33** ________ is involved in these stages. Recent research has provided **34** ________ for Spinoza's theory and it would appear that people accept all encountered information as if it were true, even if this is for an extremely **35** ________, and do not label the information as true or false until later. This is consistent with the fact that the resources for scepticism and the resources for perceiving and encoding are in **36** ________ in the brain.",
