      "text": "Populations of about two-thirds of butterfly species in Britain have declined over the past 40 years. This decline could have unpredictable effects on other species in the ecosystem, as butterflies (in their caterpillar stage) consume plant material and serve as prey for birds, bats, and other small mammals. Conservationists need to understand the reasons for this decline to reverse it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Butterflies prefer moderate outdoor conditions. Climate change is causing warmer summer temperatures, challenging butterflies. One way species are adapting is by changing the timing of their lifecycle events, a phenomenon called 'phenology'. When an event occurs earlier in the year, it's called 'advancing its phenology'."
    },
    {
      "text": "This advancement in phenology has been observed in many butterfly species. In Britain, with an average spring temperature increase of roughly 0.5 Â°C over 20 years, species have advanced their phenology by three days to a week on average. The text poses a question: does this indicate butterflies are adapting well, or are they under stress from rapid changes? The answer is currently unknown, and a new study aims to find out."
    },
    {
      "text": "The study involved researchers compiling millions of records submitted by butterfly enthusiasts. This data covered 130 species of butterflies in Great Britain over a 20-year period. Researchers used this information to estimate species abundance, distribution changes (including northward movement), and subtle changes in the timing of when each species transformed into an adult butterfly."
    },
    {
      "text": "Analysing the trends in each variable, the researchers discovered that species with more flexible lifecycles were more likely to be able to benefit from an earlier emergence driven by climate change. Some species are able to go from caterpillar to butterfly twice or more per year, so that the individual butterflies you see flying in the spring are the grandchildren or great-grandchildren of the individuals seen a year previously."
    },
    {
      "text": "Among these species, researchers observed that those which have been advancing their phenology the most over the 20-year study period also had the most positive trends in abundance, distribution and northwards extent. For these species, such as Britain's tiniest butterfly, the dainty Small Blue, whose colonies are up to a hundred strong, some develop into butterflies early in spring, allowing their summer generations to complete another reproductive cycle by autumn so that more population growth occurs."
    },
    {
      "text": "Other species, however, are less flexible and restricted to a single reproductive cycle per year. For these species, there was no evidence of any benefit to emerging earlier. Indeed, worryingly, it was found that the species in this group that specialise in very specific habitat types, often related to the caterpillar's preferred diet, actually tended to be most at harm from advancing phenology. The beautiful High Brown Fritillary, often described as Britain's most endangered butterfly, is in this group. It is found only in coppiced woodland and limestone pavement habitats. It is also a single-generation butterfly that has advanced its phenology. This suggests that climate change, while undoubtedly not the sole cause, might have played a part in the downfall of this species."
    },
    {
      "text": "All is not lost, however. Many of Britain's single-generation species show the capacity, in continental Europe, to add a second generation in years that are sufficiently warm. Therefore, as the climate continues to warm, species like the Silver-studded Blue might be able to switch to multiple generations in the UK as well, and so begin to extract benefits from the additional warmth, potentially leading to population increases."
    },
    {
      "text": "More immediately, conservationists can arm themselves with all this knowledge to spot the warning signs of species that may be at risk. The White Admiral of southern England, a much sought-after butterfly, experienced a significant increase in numbers from the 1920s but has shown a considerable decline in the past 20 years. This may be because the caterpillar exists solely on a diet of a plant called honeysuckle. But it is also likely to be due to climate change."
