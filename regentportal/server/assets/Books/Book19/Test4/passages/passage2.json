      "text": "Professor Mat Upton discovered a microbe from a deep-sea sponge that kills pathogenic bugs, suggesting a breakthrough against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. An antibiotic from sponge bacteria found over 700 meters deep in the Rockall trough (north-east Atlantic) highlights the potential of deep-sea species for new medicines. However, this potential might be lost due to the rush to exploit the deep sea's mineral resources."

      "text": "Professor Upton emphasizes the 'bioactive potential of marine resources' and the need to explore them before destruction. Many scientists are urging a halt to deep-sea mining to assess its pros and cons in terms of sustainability. Oceanographers using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) have discovered new species, including 'sea cucumbers with tails' and a rare 'Dumbo' octopus found 3,000 meters under the Pacific Ocean. These species could offer lifesaving potential, but the 'race towards commercial mining in the ocean abyss has already begun.'"

      "text": "The deep sea contains more nickel, cobalt, and rare earth metals than all land reserves combined, according to the US Geological Survey. Mining corporations argue that deep-sea exploration could diversify metal supply, driven by soaring demand for resources like copper, aluminum, and cobalt for electric car batteries and smartphones. Deep-sea mining could yield superior ore with minimal waste. The extraction process involves using converted terrestrial mining machinery to excavate materials from the seafloor (up to 6,000 meters deep), drawing a seawater slurry to surface ships, de-watering the slurry, transferring solids to another vessel for shipping, and pumping extracted seawater back down to the seafloor."

      "text": "Environmental and legal groups describe deep-sea mining as a 'new global gold rush' with potential for massive and unknown ramifications for the environment and local communities. A paper by Julie Hunter, Julian Aguon, and Pradeep Singh argues that this rush disregards environmental and social impacts and marginalizes indigenous peoples. There is an absence of a global regulatory framework. The limited knowledge of the deep seabed is concerning - the surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Venus have been studied in greater detail. As the authors conclude, 'We don't yet know what we need to know' about the deep sea."

      "text": "Scientific research shows that hydrothermal vents, formed by volcanic magma, are crucial for biodiversity and global climate, hosting a variety of animals like crustaceans, tubeworms, clams, slugs, anemones, and fish. Deep-sea mining poses a 'grave threat' to these vital functions, as extraction methods would create large sediment plumes and discharge waste back into the ocean, significantly disturbing seafloor environments. Dr. Jon Copley of the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, expresses a clear stance: 'we don't want mining on them.'"

      "text": "Mike Johnston, CEO of Nautilus, a Canadian underwater exploration company, suggests exploring this 'untapped potential' sustainably to meet society's needs, claiming that deep-sea mining's environmental impacts would be lower than land mining. He notes that oceans cover about 70% of the planet and are relatively unexplored. However, hydrothermal vent expert Verena Tunnicliffe from the University of Victoria, Canada, asserts that 'Mining will be the greatest assault on deep-sea ecosystems ever inflicted by humans.' She advocates for active vents to be off-limits to protect new knowledge and biotechnology spin-offs, and for strict controls elsewhere."
